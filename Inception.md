### Sean Krienke Interview 
I interviewed my roommate, Gabriel. I asked him the following questions:

  1. How hard or easy is it to get up in the morning to an alarm?

    It can be hard sometimes to turn off my alarm and instantly get up. Sometimes I need to motivate myself to not go back to bed.

  2. What are some ways you could make it easier to get up?

    Maybe if I put my alarm clock on the other side of my room so it would force me to get up. 

  3. How do you feel about an alarm clock that would force you to do something before turning it off? 

    I don't think I would have the time to do that. Maybe if it was just a small task, but nothing big. 
    
  4. Is there anyone else you think I should interview?

    No, I don't know of anyone.
