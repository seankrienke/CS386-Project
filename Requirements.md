#1.1 Problem Statement
  
  * The problem of waking up affects all areas of society. The impact of which is 
  missed deadlines, poor health, lack of self-discipline, low motivation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#1.2 Product Position Statement

 * For all individuals who struggle with waking up, or desire self improvement, Walkitoff is a lifestyle app that
 improves user health, and self discipline. Unlike stock alarm apps our product ensures users rise to the occasion whatver it may be.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#1.3 Value Proposition and customer segment
 
 * Walkitoff is a lifestyle app that  allows individuals who struggle with mornings, to fundamentally change how they handle beginning their day
 by utilizing location data to physically require users to get up and move.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#2 Stakeholders

* Users- The people that will be using our app are people that struggle to wake up in the morning. These users are ones that constantly snooze their alarms, and are unmotivated to get up and start their day in the morning. 

* Clients- The people that will be investing in our app are ones who believe that it could be of real use to a large demographic of people. These clients are ones who do not think that regular alarm clocks work as well as our app does at waking people up.

* Competitors- Our competitors are other alarm clock apps that have different ideas to get someone out of bed. These competitors have apps like: motion alarm clocks (shake it to stop), alarmy (take photo in a certain place), or barcode alarm clock (take picture of bar code on an item).

* Detractors- The detractors of this app will be people who feel as though regular alarm clocks work perfectly fine to wake up people.

* Developers- The developers of this app will be developers who have knowledge of android software programming, and Java software programming.

#3 Functional requirements

**1.)** The app accepts user input for time and soundList

**2.)** When the alarm sounds, it will only shut off if a certain distance is traveled.

**3.)** 500 feet is the minimum distance for the alarm to shut off, but the user can input a higher target distance.

**4.)** Every foot travelled equates to a single point, which will go towards the user's all time score.

**5.)** When a certain amount of points are accumulated, new features will become available to the user(new alarm sounds, dark mode, etc.)

**6.)** The user can also press a button to track their walking distance without having to enable an alarm

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#4 Non-functional requirements

**1.)** Resource utilization - Utilizes user device's location services

**2.)** User interface aesthetics - Contains light colors which are easy on the eyes. The user can change the color scheme to suit their tastes

**3.)** User error protection - A number wheel will be used to minimize accidentally incorrect input.

**4.)** Accessibility - Contains three items in the bottom navigation bar to make it easy to navigate: Alarm, track distance only, score details, and settings.

**5.)** Availability - Will require user location services to use alarm and distance tracking feature.

**6.)** Recoverability - Regularly updates user score in server to minimize chance of losing progress.

**7.)** Confidentiality - Location services are only acquired via user consent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#5 MVP

 *  For developing the minimal viable product for this project, we will first focus on the very foundation of this project: the alarm. When launching the app, the user should be able to give the app permission
to access location services. The user will then be able to manually set an alarm. The user can select the time via a timepicker wheel. When the selected time arrives, the alarm will soundList repeatedly until a minimum distance
of 500 feet is travelled. After that, the total distance travelled is sent to add to the users score. The MVP will have one new alarm soundList and one new theme to unlock in order to demonstrate the progression system.
